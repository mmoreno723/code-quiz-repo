# code-quiz-repo

## Description 

This application is a timed coding quiz. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Many parts of the quiz application were displayed dynamically using JavaScript. I was inspired to build this application to allow users to test their Javascript knowledge by completing this quiz. There are 4 questions in this quiz, however, many more can be added.  

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "code-quiz-repo" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

## Usage 
In order to start the quiz, you must first click the start button located in the middle of the screen. Once clicked, the first question will pop up with answer choices displayed in a button format. Click on the buttonn that you think is the correct answerand a message will be displayed if it is right or wrong. If you select a wrong answer, your time will be deducted by 5 seconds. Either way, the next question will pop up. Once you have completed the quiz, your score will be displayedand you can enter your initials to log the score. This will be saved and can be viewed anytime you click on the "highscores" button in the top left of the screen.
