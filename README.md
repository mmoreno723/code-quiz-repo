# code-quiz-repo

## Description 

This is a code quiz website. The intended result was to have multiple questions display dynamically on the screen, but unfortunately, i was not able to get the
Javascript to work properly. This project is uncomplete, but I learned much about JavaScript while creating this website. While there are parts missing, I  
was able to get funtions working like the start timer and start quiz function to display the quiz box. 

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "new-generator-repo" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

## Usage 
You may use this to complete the coding quiz 

## Credits 
Thank you to third party websites like MDN and W3 for providing me with lots of information to complete this assignment.
